## target_user_profile

As the creator of this HTML code, my primary audience is potential employers, recruiters, or anyone interested in learning more about me, Joel Mar√≠a Montes. It's designed for individuals with an objective perspective and knowledge of web pagination, particularly those focused on web development and microcomputer systems. Upon reviewing my resume, they will notice an emphasis on learning and personal self-improvement. I describe myself as a dedicated and team-oriented person with traits like adaptability, autonomy, and proactivity. The expected users are individuals seeking information about my qualifications and skills, particularly in the field of IT and computer science. These users are expected to find a comprehensive overview of my educational background, skills, and personal details to assess my suitability for job opportunities.

## information_architecture

For this single-page project, I've structured the information into several sections, beginning with a profile description and then detailing skills, contact information, academic history, computer proficiency, and language skills. I've used clear headings to logically organize the content, making it easy for visitors to navigate and understand my background and qualifications. These sections are defined as follows:

1. Profile: Includes my name and provides a brief overview of my personality, work style, and desire to learn in the world of IT.

2. Aptitudes and Skills: Lists key skills such as adaptability, teamwork, autonomy, and proactivity.

3. Contact Information: Offers contact details for communication.

4. Academic History: Describes my educational journey and certifications in the field.

5. Computer Knowledge: Showcases my proficiency in various technologies using visual elements.

6. Languages: Summarizes my language proficiency.

The logical flow of this information architecture allows employers, recruiters, or anyone interested in me to quickly grasp my qualifications and experiences.

## visual_design

The visual design of the HTML code is intentionally minimalistic and straightforward, focusing on simplicity and ease of readability. The use of a one-column layout and consistent "Trebuchet MS" font throughout the document enhances overall visual coherence. Inclusion of headings at various hierarchical levels helps in better content organization. Additionally, the use of images, such as icons and logos for skills, adds visual appeal and enhances the overall presentation of skills and experience. The absence of excessive styling elements maintains a clean and professional look, ensuring that the content remains the primary focus for the viewer. This design, conceived in a more minimalist manner, incorporates a softer color palette to visually be less intrusive and not distract from the content. Two primary colors include a muted gray-blue (used to visually separate the "About Me" panel from the detailed "Skills/Experience" section) and yellow (used to emphasize CV section titles, alternating based on the nearest color).
